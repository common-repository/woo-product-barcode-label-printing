* Label configuration is available via the settings page too. Example: You can make the size of the font of the Price bigger if you like. Also, if you want to use bigger or smaller sized labels you can change the settings to accommodate this.
* There is a live preview of the label in the settings page. You can make changes like making the product title text bigger and then get a live preview of what it would look like.
* Three pre-sets are available in the settings if you use different size labels in your business.
